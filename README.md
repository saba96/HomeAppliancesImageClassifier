# Image classifier

An image classifier for dishwasher, washing machine and gas range using resnet34. \
I ran my code using google colab; however, you can use it in any environment you like, but you should set it up yourself. I recommend google colab as it is easy to set up. For more information please check ** HomeAppliancesImageClassifier.ipynb **  notebook.
